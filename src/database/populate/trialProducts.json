I have dropped this and it has skid across horribly rough asphalt dozens of times, and both the cover and wheel look new. Well... except the pedals and handle! Great investment, helps reduce impact to plastic and keep scratches down. It also holds my pads in place after having to remove/reinstall them for servicing. Softer on the inner legs too. Waiting on bigger pedals and then my 18L truly will feel like a plush luxury vehicle.",

One thing to note is I had an issue where the cover was bulging (kinda like the fit wasn't snug) at the front and near the bottom where the cover attaches. I thought forever the it was loose and just a one off defect and it may be but I'm thinking at this point that it's normal. Basically you have to pull at the light and sensor/power button cutouts to make it snug. NOT pull the bottom down to make it snug because that will just cause the same problem on the other side of  the wheel. I imagine the covers are hand made so entirely possible mine doesn't fit exactly right. Side note and a nice touch was that they put nice soft leather on the little pockets that attach to the inside of the wheel casing/side panels to keep the case on. I think the wheel looks a lot better with the cover on since it smooths over the sharp edges the 18XL naturally has. Has perfectly protected my wheel completely from some gnarly falls/drops. Don't forget to take it off every couple weeks or even sooner to clean the dust that builds up on the underside of the cover and in the leather pockets that attach to the lower casing/side panels. Overall thumbs up, definitely worth it!! Wish they had this for the MSX and other wheels!",

I liked the original white/grey model but the stealth model is definitely nice.    I'm glad I was able to be part of the batch that was the last of the 512wh variants but understand the reasons for standardizing.    \n\nJason, Drew, and the rest of the folks over at eWheels are top notch and being here in Hawaii, one of the only retailers shipping to the 50th state!    I placed my order back in July when these things were on back-order, but they've been fantastic in providing fast communication to any of my questions and concerns throughout.    This is my first wheel, with my sights set on a larger wheel in the near future(V11/RS/Sherman).    Admittedly, the first time I laid eyes on the MTen3 in a Youtube video(thanks Marty), I knew instantly that was the wheel for me; It has the perfect blend of size, power, and speed for my needs.    I know some riders of larger wheels might pooh pooh this little guy, but because I have plans to purchase a larger wheel in the future, I wanted something that was going to be very different and something that I would keep, as opposed to having multiple wheels that had too many similarities in size, specs, and ride characteristics.    The MTen3 covers all those bases and also looks great all in black!",

This is my first EUC and I neither skateboard nor have experience in any like activity. I'm a total newbie to this. \n\nThe first minutes were shaky but after an hour I was able to glide 15'-20', though using a chain link fence as a safety rail. It does feel wobbly still but I figure more practice will acclimate me, so I'm heading out again this morning for another hour of practice. I am completely satisfied that I will be able to master this. What a fun and practical investment this was.",

This is my second wheel, the KingSong 14d was my first wheel. The Mten3 wide tire makes ride more stable than the narrow 14d tire, so I like it on walking paths and other areas where crowds are, because you can balance even at low speeds. I've taken it up mild inclines and it handles my size with no problems at all!! One of the reasons I purchased this was to take on flights, because my medical condition makes it extremely hard to walk long distance, so this can literally fit in my backpack and I can visit new areas and site see without stressing about over exerting myself. Only thing I hate is the look of the lights, not my style at all!! I painted mine flat black and painted over the lights, YeapR sure did. Haha. \nI've been upgrading to bigger faster wheels fairly fast so I haven't really put this wheel to the test, so I cant comment on range, speed and durability. The fastest I've have it was 18mph on smooth interior floor, it does get a lil squirrely at higher speeds on surfaces with imperfections, so I'm nervous going high speeds on this outside but it can be done, you can watch YouTube videos of people riding really fast with skill. \nIt's awesome that we can have a wheel that fits into a backpack and that goes 25mph and carry someone my size with ease, awesome!\nMy thoughts about ewheels:\nI've purchased 4 wheels from ewheels, so far and they have proven to be true professionals when it comes to providing the best product to the public and they are true professionals when it comes to providing the best customer service!!\nI'm shocked at how quickly they have answered all of questions. Believe you me, I have bugged them a lot with questions! Haha \nI'll be buying my next wheel from ewheels, I just have to decide which one to buy!",

MTen3 512Wh/800W Motor.\n\n\"Tiny but might\" is what I'd refer it to, speedy and not needy due to the power of this little wheel and  basically no maintenance! \n\nPros:\nCompact, nice torque, fast, nimble, durable, FUN!\n\nI've never own or knew about electric unicycle until a few weeks ago, after doing lots of research and with the help of eWheels team I've concluded that the MTen3 would be my best first wheel.\nZero regrets on getting this wheel, not having any prior experiences of riding an EUC it only took me 15 minutes to get going. My tip to you is to just get on and ride, it'll be hard, it'll tire you out, it'll bite you in the ankle a few times and again, but it's totally worth it. You can't buy happiness? WRONG, buy this wheel and you'll not only have happiness, but you'll create wonderful memories with it. Sometimes a little painful but it's part of the sport.\n\nCons:\nSpeed is fast! but is it bad to ask for faster? In this case yes, if you go too fast and you're not use to this wheel, you'll encounter \"speed wobble\" ideal speed for me is 18-22 mph.\nYou'll feel a lot of the road that you're riding on, smooth roads are no problem, however if you ride over bumps and cracks... you'll fell it. Best to ride with your knees bent.\nBattery life... this is something I'm over expecting, I'm happy with my current riding distance (it hurts to ride long distance due to my conditioning) but when I'm more conditioned to ride further I'd would love for it to go at least 30 miles distance. Currently I'm getting 14-18 miles based on how I ride and my weight (190lbs on a good day without gears on) with average speed of 12 miles per  hour.\nOther than those little picky things, I'm so happy with it.\n\nIn all, grab it and never let it go. Trust me, you'll want to own 2-3 wheels on average once you get into this sport. \n\nAmazing beginner wheel.\n\n*** Wheel PSI is recommended by me around 35 PSI if you're 190lbs, however you'll get more speed wobble if you're not use to it. Just drop PSI to 25-30 for more control, down side to this is you'll get less miles in range due to the motor having to work harder but it'll feel more smooth.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nPlease wear a helmet....",

This thing is super easy to learn, especially if your into any other type of activity that requires balance while moving. Once you’ve got the hang of it you’ll notice how agile and nimble this wheel can be. Iv been practicing in parking lots, and weaving around marked lines has been so engaging that before i knew it 17+ miles had been traveled just swerving around. The compact size of this thing makes it easier to carry around and the fact that it’s less aggressive looking than other wheels attracts less unwanted attention. It would be nice if it came with a handle, but Here’s the thing that I don’t like about this wheel...even though it’s small or maybe because it is.....it wobbles like a bucking bronco at 14+ mph.....This could be due to my inexperience but I doubt that’s the only reason why. So far my impression is that this is a really fun, smooth and agile wheel best suited for agility and cruising at slow to moderate speeds. Unless you have the reflexes of a cat or have been practicing your rodeo skills be sure to wear safety gear because it’s unavoidable that at some point your going to need it.",

Despite Mini4 being quite compact and lightweight, it can be quite cumbersome when using in public transportation, carrying up stairs, etc. So I needed something more compact and lightweight... a \"pocket rocket\". Mten3 just is such a pocket rocket! It's perfect for getting around the city and even for some mild offroad fun, too!\n\nIt's so small that it fits in a small $10 backpack sized for middle-school kids. And despite only 325Wh capacity (I bought the 84V/325Wh version), I can still go 20 miles on it - same range as with Mini4, which has almost double the capacity! (614Wh) It's amazingly efficient. (I'm very heavy - right at the max allowable weight - and it's just stunning to me that a little thing I can carry in a small backpack, can go such a distance, with almost half the weight (10kg Mten3 vs. 16kg Mini4), half the battery, and perhaps third the size.)\n\nIt took me a couple of days to learn to ride, but it's not bad. I think the steep-ish angle of the pedals helps to \"lock in\" the wheel between your legs, which increases stability. The agility of this pocket rocket is amazing. It very easy to ride even on crowded sidewalks like in tourist places - when you see a clearing between people, you accelerate rapidly and \"jump\" into the next \"slot\". The precision of riding Mten3 is just fantastic - you can efficiently \"percolate\" any crowd.\n\nThe included wrist protectors are a nice touch - they're decent, very compact, and quite comfortable. I took a couple of falls with them - they saved my hands like a champ. The larger black pedals and the lift-off switch are very nice, too.\n\nOverall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase. Amazingly fast delivery, too - placed the order, next day I have a new toy in my hands! Highly recommend it. You won't regret getting Mten3 from eWheels!",

Much more sensitive and you have to balance it out and adjust pedal level. Manual sucks and had to watch some You-tube vids to figure it out. Updated app is OK. Experimented with soft, medium and hard ride settings and for now am using soft. Hard to find what each setting means?  Bonus feature discovered. New button by handle which disengages motor when lifted. Work in progress for me cause of differences compared to my 14” wheel which I can use pretty handily now. Think over time MTen3 will be great for riding around neighborhood. Not really a commuter wheel. Recommend that eWheels translate or make a short instruction manual for this model and any other Gotway products if they continue to sell the line. Just my 2 cents",

After practicing 10 - 30 minutes daily for a week, the rider can free mount, ride on bumpy pavements, making turns, stopping gracefully. But the rider is still not good enough to handle the crowds. The rider also rides at a very slow speed, the max speed is only 8.5 mph right now. \n\nBiggest complain is the lack of handle. If your feet need some rest from riding and you want to walk for a block, you have to either carry it or bend down and push it. Not ideal. \n\nOverall a great buy for sure :)",

You can even put in a backpack if you don't mind carrying about 22 lbs of weight. Definitely not a beginner wheel. When I start riding it coming from KS18S which is my first wheel, there is some sort of riding adjustment but not too difficult. It is very nimble and good in tight spaces particulary leisurely cruising in slow speed in a crowded street. However, doesn't recommend it for long ride especially speed above 10 mph, the wheel can wobble if you don't pay attention. In addition, you need more breaks during rides because your feet can easily get numb from standing. Unlike my KS18S, it is comfortable for cruising and long rides without much fatigue on my feet because it has a seat I can use allowing my legs and feet to rest while riding. Always wear full face helmet and other protective gears...don't underestimate this little bad boy, it has a lot of torque! Safety first while having fun! Between my KS18S and this wheel, I will be riding more the mten3 because of being compact, powerful and easy to bring to any places! Get one yours now, you will not regret. -- Lorenzo",

I have an electric skateboard (backfire g2t) and an electric scooter (inokim ox super). I like the MTen3 way better than the previous two. \nThe electric skateboard is super-fast (good), it stops super-fast (bad). The bad is due to the skateboard slows down before you do and the only thing that’s keeping you on the board is the grip tape. Second, the solid wheel vibration wears out and numbs my feet. It does not turn, and road cracks & bumps will cause big hurt if not careful. Unless the road condition is perfectly smooth, it sucks.\nThe electric scooter doesn’t have any of the issues of the electric skateboard and better in every way (because it has 10-inch tires, disc brakes, 800w – 1200w motor, 20Ah battery, and suspensions). However, it is 28kg and BIG (worse than a golf bag)!\nPro:\n1.\tLight 22-25 lbs. (I think it is the lightness of all EUC wheels).\n2.\tCompact!!!\n3.\tGood acceleration and breaking.\n4.\tRange 20 miles easy (70kg person).\nCon:\n1.\tNot for beginners (I learned that hard way, first time with a EUC).\n2.\tWheel size the causes of lots of wobbles (Either from the rider or the road condition).\n3.\tLower speed limit “below 20mph” (It’s a safety issue, size of the wheel, high speed, equals to more and stronger wobbles).\n4.\tSmall peddle means the feet get tired and numb easier.\n5.\tTires (wish the tires have more grip and knobbier).\nTips for beginners:\n1.\tFind your center of gravity on the wheel (you will know once you find it).\n2.\tTrain on smooth pavement.\n3.\tPractice stopping.\n4.\tMount and Ride with your chest out.\n5.\tLook and turn your shoulder toward the direction you want to go.\n6.\tRelax your feet and legs (Stiff legs and feet causes wobbles).\n7.\tAt least 10 plus hours before you can ride the MTen3 confidently and comfortably.\n8.\tBe very vigilant looking at the road condition ahead of you (it’s not the potholes that will cause you problems, it’s the side bumps that will make you fall).\nWishlist: MTen3, everything the same in an 18inch wheel.",

The wheel took a bad beating from my learning process and it keeps going.  Charges in about 3 hours or so and that will get someone about a 1.25 hours of reasonable pace riding in the Summer.  Two maintenance issues that came up.  After 3 months, the tire deflated.  I didn't know how to put slime in it and shipped it back to Ewheels who got it fixed and also upgraded the foot petals for a modest sum.

          "content": "The MTen3 is my first wheel and it has exceeded all expectations.  I’ve had it a week and rode 70km. By now, I am comfortable riding it and I feel as if it responds to my thoughts.  I wish I had purchased this years ago.  The wheel accelerates quickly and feels satisfyingly torquey.   I’ve never fallen (except the very first time I tried to stand on it), but it has come out from under me a few times due to my errors.   The bottoms of the pedals are scraped up and there are a few scrapes around the edges. The scratches don’t show on the white parts but they do show a bit on the black parts.\n\nI can go slowly and I can go fast, but I don’t feel comfortable faster than 18mph as the vehicle starts to wobble, however, it is entirely possible that the wobbling originates from me.  My feet get tired after about 20 minutes, but every day I have more endurance and can go further.  The sides of my calves hurt for the first few days.\n\nThe MTen3 does not struggle when I put my two children in a double-stroller and push them to and from daycare which is a bit less than a mile through the city.  I mostly use this vehicle for downtown commuting in a major US city.  It fits in my gym locker! I don’t go down (or up) curbs with it, but there are no shortages of bumps, dips, and cracks. I’ve had it out in light rain before with no problems. I’ve also taken it on a few longer bike-path trips which are very enjoyable.  It is easy to pick up and carry like a briefcase and only one person in a hundred will notice that I’m carrying something uncommon; people probably assume it is a cooler or a trendy bag and don't look twice.  It fits in a standard paper grocery bag (if I want to be very inconspicuous).\n\nThe Cons: \n1.\tNo Manual\n2.\tDownloading and Side-loading the app took a few attempts.\n3.\tThe seam in the plastic opposite the underside of the handle is rough enough to cut your knuckles, especially when you try to carry it while wearing wrist guards.    You can mitigate this by putting a piece of clear (scotch) tape along the seam.  I wear thin, fingerless- UV gloves under my wrist guards which protects me from the seam.  \n4.\tIt does not turn off when you lift it up.\n5.\tThe on/off beep is very loud and you have to hold the button for a few seconds. \n6.\tThe handle should be rounded for ease on the hand; as you will be carrying it a lot. \n7.\tI wish it included a cover. \n\nCaveat: \nThis vehicle can be carried around easily and inconspicuously, but before you purchase, make sure that you can comfortably carry 25lb pounds in one hand.   \n\nIn conclusion, I am fully satisfied and delighted with the MTen3.  It is great for last-mile commutes, errands, and joy-riding.  It is very practical for anyone who can easily carry 25lbs in one hand.",

          "content": "Solowheel glide 3-  It took me 4 one hour sessions over the course of four days to learn to ride.  It took my daughter 2 one hour sessions to learn how to ride.  The past 200 miles of use has been fantastic!  I have taken the solowheel on paved roads, sidewalks, paved trails, climbed up fairly steep hills, and I have done some slight off roading.  I have ridden it though mud and puddles of water that were just below the pedals.  The pedals are up high which makes it nice to just glide though the various environments that are thrown your way.  \n\nTiltback on the pedals begins coming in at 15mph and you can push the glide to 18mph, but any extended time and your feet will get tired relatively quickly due to the the nature of the incline of the pedals during tiltback.  Its sleek design looks futuristic and the LEDs just make for a cool looking night ride. \n\nDuring the learning process I crashed the solowheel multiple times and it just kept on ticking.  I've put the glide 3 through the ringer on numerous occasions and even though it has several scuff marks and scratches it still turns on and functions like it did when I pulled it out of the box.  \n\nRange-  I'm 5'7\" and 200ish lbs give or take a few and I can get about 17 miles before it's reading below 10%.\n\nAcceleration and handling- This thing is light, nimble, easy to turn, and easy to learn on.  Quick bursts of speed are fantastic from a dead stop or even at speed.\n\nModifications/Alterations-  *Disclosure* I come from the automotive world where we can take vehicles, mod them to be faster and look more visually appealing to us.  I find this department a little lacking, but I believe that is with most EUCs.  While the customization for the LED's is neat there is not whole lot more you can do with this wheel.  I did upgrade the pedals to a much larger size.  This was totally worth the upgrade as the expansion of foot space made it ride easier, ride more comfortably, and aided in maneuverability.  The XL pedals really should have come on this wheel from the factory.  If you are seriously considering this wheel, make this your first purchase after the safety gear.  (Reason for 4 stars and not 5) \n\nCons (Reason for 4 stars and not 5) - I would say the headlight could use some work.  While it's sufficient in low lighting areas in urban neighborhoods;  night riding is less than steller through dark places.  I would highly recommend a flashlight of some sort if that's when you plan to ride.  The inmotion app that you use for the solowheel constantly disconnects from the wheel.  However, when it stays connected it's for the most part user friendly and some small adjustments can be made.  \n\nWith all that being said this is a great starter wheel that you can grow into, however I find the cruising speed just not fast enough for me and I will be upgrading to a more robust  wheel.",

Obviously, the 16x has more power and performance, however, it also made me appreciate how wonderfully light and small the Glide 3 is.  I had considered selling the Glide 3, but have decided to keep it.  The ease of transporting the small and light Glide 3 will make it more practical than the 16x in some situations.   It easily fits in the trunk of my Miata and I can ride it anywhere I used to ride my bicycle.    For the price, the Glide 3 is an amazing machine with size and weight as an advantage over higher level wheels if you need to carry or transport it, or if you need to store it in a locker.",

          "content": "Bought this from ewheels about 2 months ago as my first wheel.  It’s definitely a great wheel and has taken several top speed crashes without any major damage, I can verify it’s durability.  However, after putting 150 miles on it, I feel I’ve already outgrown it.  Wish I had just spent a little more and bought a faster wheel from the start that I could have grown into.  IMHO, nobody just starting out has the ability to ride as fast as it will go.  That comes with time.  But, my next machine will need to go just a little bit faster so that it doesn’t seem slow when max speed is achieved.  Once I achieved it, as comfortable as it is, I am wanting a little bit more.  The only reason I say this is that at half battery, it will beep at you incessantly trying to tilt back and reduce your speed to what feels like a crawl.  As a safety issue, it works great, but as you gain experience on the wheel and near the 100 mile mark of riding, I am needing just as you will probably also will be wanting, a wheel with more speed and range because of how fun these great little machines are to ride.  100 miles really isn’t that far when you start having as much fun on yours as I have had on mine.  It’s only a little annoying at first when the battery reaches the half way point, but, after a little time and riding experience it does become really very annoying.  You want to go faster but can’t.  Really sucks when you’re 10 miles from the house and it feels like you are crawling on the way back and takes you 2-3 times longer and beeping at you the whole way.  Also, it is much more difficult to ride at slower speeds.  It takes a lot more energy out of you with the additional effort it takes to ride it.  You are going to be a lot more tired when you get back.  In hindsight, I would have purchased a different wheel with more speed and battery.  I just didn’t realize how much time or fun I was going to be having while riding it.  I love my EUC.  It truly is a blast to ride.  One of the best entertainment purchases I’ve ever made.  I’m still undecided on my next wheel.",

          "content": "This is my first electric unicycle. I upgraded from an inexpensive electric skateboard in order to find something that 1) can handle the steepest of San Francisco hills, 2) can handle the terrible road surface in some areas of the city, and 3) has a decent range. \n\nThis EUC does all of those things. It can go up and down the steepest hill in Potrero without issue. The cracks and potholes that stopped my electric skateboard in it's tracks are damped out by the V8. The range is exceptional. \n\nMy two complaints: \n\n1) The tire was misaligned on the rim at first, which I didn't think to check since I never had to check on a bicycle. This caused some significant instability of the V8 at higher speeds, leading to oscillations and many near-crashes. Deflating the tire significantly and ensuring it was centered on the wheel during and after reinflation fixed this issue for me. I wish this had been a standard warning from the get go. \n\n2) When I grab the handle of the V8, I oftentimes scrape my knuckles to the point of bleeding. There is a seam directly under the handle, and sliding your fingers in and out in order to grip the handle catches this seam and sometimes rips off some skin. I put a small strip of clear duct tape over this area to prevent this. Very unpleasant. \n\nOverall a good electric unicycle. Performs well in San Francisco rain (aka barely a drizzle, but wet roads), was easy to learn, and the top speed is just about what I'm comfortable with as a beginner. I had to take off a star for the seam-finger issue though. I still recommend this to others.",

After doing quite a bit of research both on the right EUC (eg for beginners) and who to buy from, I landed on the Glide 3 as well as purchasing from eWheels.  I did most of my research via YouTube.  What I found basically was that the Glide 3 was a good introductory EUC at a price point that wasn't a barrier.  Not too fast/powerful, but just right.  Very smooth and easy to learn on.  Plus, the fact that a cover comes with the Glide 3 is a plus.  While I was learning, I can't tell you how many times I \"dumped\" (eg had to hop off) the Glide 3.\n\nWith respect to eWheels, a lot of the prominent YouTubers, w.r.t. EUCs, spoke highly of eWheels.  So, after doing my research, I felt comfortable investing in my first EUC with eWheels.   Jason was also quick to answer questions that I had.\n\nAfter about three weeks, though, I've already invested in a 2nd EUC.  My 13 yr old son has enjoyed learning to ride as well.

I've ridden pedal unicycles all my life ( Im 54 now) and the forward backwards balance is no problem on the glide 3 but the side to side was.  The next morning I put a lot more air in the tire (15 more lbs) to 55. I got on it and leaned a little further forward and off i went!  I had read that riding one with lower tire pressure is easier to control and its simply not true.  It decreases the lean forward to go faster and virtually eliminates high speed wobs. Its truly an amazing vehicle and has just the right amount of speed.  Im not afraid of speed by any means but for the tire size its the perfect comfort zone  at speed for stability and you pass every cyclist, especially uphill. Im a fairly big guy at 190 and it has no problem buzzing me up a long uphill straightaway that would be a long and arduous haul for even a healthy experienced bicyclist. The roads are pretty rough where I live but there are no major potholes which could be detrimental to your health but I biffed it around the corner pretty good and it takes a pretty good beating.  Although I'm sure I could handle a short staircase I'm not sure i would put it through that kind of abuse and expect it to last over 1000 miles without a major overhaul and repairs. It might but why risk it.  Its a great machine. Treat it with respect and it will do everything it says milagewise and speedwise.  The battery pack appears to be quite healthy.   The app sucks and it takes a little to figure the lights. Its headlight is bright but at speed its iffy, so i wear a 500 lumen lamp on my helmet at night.  You youngsters out there wear your damn helmet because you are going to fall hard at speed.  Trust me I know. Lol . All in all I made a great decision on my purchase because Ewheels company gave me an education in itself on all of the eunicycles and the one that would suit my abilities best. I'm no slouch and am in good shape with the athleticism it takes to ride one and it suits me perfect.  I give it a five out of five so far with only about 60 miles on it so far.  Thanks guys I love it far more than I thought I thought would.   For what it does you simply cant beat the price. Job well done....      Pete in Las Cruces NM",

However, these issues feel minor to me as ewheels has been super helpful in advising me on how to fix it, as well as being very open to feedback. If you have done research on the product and are paying attention, you can catch these issues early on. \nThe wheel gives me Life! It's been only a few weeks and I am already riding it. Love it!",

          "content": "An extremely fun wheel to ride (extremely recommended for urban/city riding). I would highly recommend purchasing this wheel as a starter wheel and upgrading to see if a higher end wheel will suit your needs or not (you may get lucky and find a new release that blows away a wheel you were previously looking at). Not only that, but this wheel comes with a cover and wrist guards which adds value to the purchase and protects the wheel as you learn. The wheel itself is smooth and with time feels like second nature. You want to go somewhere? It'll take you there in a snap. Another great benefit is the button under the handle that keeps the wheel from spinning if you need to bring it up stairs (making it ideal for the city).\n\nThe reason why I marked this wheel down is due to battery capacity and higher end performance. The battery is good (comparable to a Onewheel XR [I enjoy riding with onewheel groups]), but it doesn't offer what similar level wheels offer. I wish Inmotion upgraded this wheel to a capacity similar to the Kingsong 16S so I get just a bit more range (maybe power too? :3). Performance-wise I can only go 15 mph on the wheel before pushback slows me down (making me much slower than my Onewheel companions). It makes catching up uncomfortable, because riding through pushback for a few miles can be exhausting on the feet and legs.\n\nThat being said, I (may be) pushing the limitations of the wheel in group rides, so I'll likely upgrade to a larger wheel. However, I did not know I needed more performance until I started joining groups! This wheel has made me more active than before, meeting more people than I have before. It will likely be my solo riding backup commuter since the benefits and convenience of this wheel make it great all-around easy cruising wheel. But, I digress since this wheel is priced at such a great point that I can't really complain too much! ;)\n\nSummary: This wheel is recommended as a super fun starter wheel or an urban/city commuter due to its convenience and features. However, if you're thinking of joining group rides, a higher performance wheel is recommended to keep up!",

You can’t go wrong with this wheel if it’s your first wheel and want to see if the hobby is for you. By the way I weigh 235 pounds and so far the wheel has worked flawlessly and has never felt underpowered. Ewheels also supplied me with a protective cover that came with the wheel for free.

As for durability I am not worried about breaking it - it is built like a tank. \n\nIf you're on the fence about ordering one of these like I was, I say just pull the trigger!

And “felt” that I would want to attempt them on the V10, all that safety talk about weight versus motor power on inclines got in my head...

I'm 5'-8\", 155lbs, mid 40s and I've been reading about EUCs ever since I stumbled upon them after initially looking for an adult razor type scooter. Jason got back quickly and recommended the Glide 3 which I bought the next day. I've never even used a segway so I knew it was going to be a learning curve. Over five days, about two hours per day, one or more days off in between, I've logged 40 miles now. First few days were hard, and this experience makes learning to snowboard seem easy. Anyway, I have some sore muscles below the knee that I never even knew existed, but I've gotten pretty good, even at slow speeds. I haven't bumped it above the factory 83% and I'm still trying to understand how the calibration settings work, but overall I love this thing. I've never even seen an EUC in person before but watched a lot of youtube videos over the past year, which probably helps with the learning curve. Anyway, I highly recommend this for a beginner or intermediate. The neoprene cover is nice and kept it from getting scratched the first few days. Yesterday I took the kids to the park and my 6 year old got tired riding her bike up hill on the way home. I grabbed one handle bar and her seat and this thing had enough power to easily push both of us up a nice long hill (ok, my back is a little sore from bending over a little). I almost bought a ninebot C but when I read about people upgrading, I'm glad I spent a little more. eWheels was super convenient and I got a shipping notice about two hours after I placed the order.

I wanted to have second wheel, more range, more speed and integrated handle. I also did not want it to emit loud high pitch noise and did not want it to be to heavy.\n\nFrom my internet research I had zero options... Then I heard about Inmotion V8 several weeks ago. The process of purchase was great. I ordered it one afternoon (4PM), it was sent next day early morning (got email of dispatch at 4AM).\n\nI also recommend getting this particular wheel, yet you have to ask yourself - if you have different expectations, then maybe some other wheel would suit you better. For me - V8 seems like, well, created for me :). I wanted a wheel:\n1. For commuting 10-12km one way, without having to recharge at work (to carry less things in backpack). V8 can do that.\n2. With more range for more fun and more options. With E+ I sometimes needed to go taxi one way, and unicycle the other way because of not enough range for my needs. Now I'm able to go 34km (did 33.6km once with 5% battery left, going around 23-25kph).\n3. With integrated handle, so that I can go inside a shop etc. V8 has it, I like it very much, checked in practice inside shop - it's great. Oh, and also this button which stops the motor when you lift V8 up - I did not realize how much it can simplify my life, very good idea and implementation.\n4. With more speed for more fun. I often felt (on E+) that I need just a little bit more speed. V8 has what I need and riding it feels really solid.\n5. Not too heavy - V8 is around the same weight as E+. In practice it felt lighter, so I checked on weighing machine and it showed it's really lighter (but I wouldn't trust this machine much).\n6. No high-pitch loud noise - V8 sound is really pleasant for my ears. I really appreciate LEDs (for me - the more the better :)). A friend told me the wheel looks like from Tron movie (on the predefined factory settings).\n\nThe driving is similar to E+, but pedals are a lot more stiffer (I use riding mode 0 on E+) and they also react totally different on turns. On E+ they dive in (firmware 1.3.5) on turns, here it's the opposite, so I had some small learning to do. I think I prefer the riding mode of V8 and turns of E+, but on the other hand - I'm just accustomed to that feeling so cannot judge as of now.\nI have nearly 3000km on E+ and nearly 300km on V8 and I believe that in the end I'll simply like both types of behaviours :).\n\nOh, and I forgot about look: this wheel is simply beautiful :). After spending some time with V8, commuting, going to shops, having fun - my opinion about it is very very positive.",

I am a beginner to the electric unicycle and I was very hasty in the purchase of my first wheel: a 14-inch, generation 1 electric unicycle from a local shop. After a few hours of riding I realized that I had outgrown this wheel that caused pain to my shins and had limited potential. A brief but informative \"Let's Talk\" with Jason helped me make up my mind to place a pre-order. It took a few days extra to get the shipment since this was the first batch to Europe from the factory but it was very reassuring to get a notification from eWheels once it reached the continent. Delivery to me came four days later. I have to say that the V8 is a dream to ride and very responsive. It gives me no pain to my legs at all and I haven't even attached the supplied soft-pads. It handles the dirt roads in my training path with ease and the transition to the new wheel was quite a no-brainer. The only down-side I can find is that it is easy to accidentally toggle the power button when grabbing the handle while wearing gloves. OK, so it wouldn't hurt with a good back light either as the dark season is approaching but I found the front light to be very apt for my dark roads. Summary: top-notch wheel, top-notch dealer!",

          "content": "Going to a larger EUC\nMy Impressions on upgrading from a 14\" Inmotion V5F to 16\" V8\n\nI got my Inmotion V5F , catchy name huh, on March 30th 2017 and it took me 3 months 2 weeks to put 1000 miles on it. It was an upgrade from a Ninebot one A1, which served as my learning machine. So 14\" wheels are all I have ever known. I love the portability and toyishness of the 14\" under 30lbs wheels. They prepare you to get bounced off by their very lack of mass and weight beneath your feet. I often wonder why I even need them to glide above the ground, and maybe they are just a crutch for this un-noticed skill I have had all along. Then I hit a hidden salad bowl sized pothole and wonder why I am running all of a sudden with my wheel skidding off to the side. They are fun! So when I decided to get more speed and distance I settled in on the 16\" Inmotion V8 for looks (really sleek even with the dizzy lights), the name (I am a car guy so V8), and the familiarity with the Inmotion ride.\nMore on the Inmotion V8 specs and review later. After getting the V8 calibrated with the app to unlock the speed and tweak the lights and warnings it was time to test ride. I had tried the 16\" and the 18\" wheels at a gas station during a brief meeting with my local EUC club. They were ACM and Kingsong models and really had a vehicle type of ride stability. They felt like firm machinery compared to my nimble V5F lark. The Kingsong 14S and 16S were not available yet to buy, but on another EUC ride I was fortunate enough to try out an 840wh Kingsong 14C from Jeff and found it to be more than capable at getting me up and down the hollywood hills in Griffith Park. It never labored and has great pick up in acceleration. It was a bit more clunky in the corners than my V5F, but that might have been Beginner Wheel Skill Disorder. BWSD is the term I give for the unwieldy feel that a new wheel will have until your body has adjusted to the different mechanics and foot weight distributions that arise from different wheels. This was what I was feeling with the new V8 as I ventured down my hill towards sunset blvd. It would pull to one side or the other in a different way from my old V5F. Perhaps it is learning my style as I learn its. The phenomenon is still the same if not more pronounced with a brand new out of the package wheel. Inmotion has a - SCV forward correction - function in its app that will work after about 10 miles of use. Other models have ride feel adjustments in their Apps, and it is suggested to dial in or use these functions as it will make the break in time more comfortable, and give you more control. This worked for me as well as my body was adjusting to the new geometry of the larger wheel.\nGoing up in wheel size doesn't make you taller, since the pedals are at the same height, but the body of the wheel will rest at different areas of your legs. I have a blister on my right upper ankle and a slight bruise on my left shin as evidence of this. The V8 is only 1\" taller than the V5F with a trolley handle. However the top of the body is 2\" taller. So for a short guy, the physics of leaning due to the taller y-axis(body) makes the leverage from the x-axis(pedals) less. My body either needs to lean out side to side further or with more force. Its not much more, but there does seem to be a natural learning curve. Combined with the additional weight of the wheel, these are some things to be aware of when upsizing, even within the same company. Obviously since all EUC companies have different designs, this happens when switching Wheel companies as well.\nI ride my V5F and V8 along the bike lanes and paths of Los Angeles. The streets in L.A. Bow up to drain water to the gutters and the bike lanes and space next to curbs is on a slight angle. This angle can force the wheel into the curb unless I ride the wheel at a little bit more than a 90° angle, leaning slightly into traffic. This has taken some adjustment and learning, so I have had to be more careful even though I have more than 1000 miles of riding experience. Turning is different, not better or worse as far as tightness of turns and control. The wobbles are back as the placement of my feet is adjusted to the new weight distribution, blabbity blah, blah. Enough of the first impressions, Lets skip 50 miles into the future...\nI really enjoy the 3mph extra cruising speed and max speed in the upgrade. I got to work within a few minutes of my car time average. The V8 feels both stable and nimble at cruising speeds of 15-19mph. The other day I rode over a bowl type of pothole that used to shake my 14\" wheel, but the 16\" took it in stride even while taking me by surprise. This is only day 3, but the wheel is beginning to learn my unorthodox extreme leaning into the curves. I am still getting used to the larger circumference while turning, because I am so used to the smaller wheel. Its getting much more natural with every new trip. Driving over shallow sand and loose dirt is easier with the heavier V8, but still a lot like dry water skiing. The 800 watt motor easily moves me uphills in dirt and asphalt or to maximum speed without laboring. I like to ride my EUC like a leaf balancing on a spinning top, and the V8 has that sort of stable lightness of a ride.\nI am only 145 lbs. but the V8 only gets around 21 or 22 miles, with pushing it to the limits and stopping for stop signs, before you reach the dreaded last bar or 20% battery left. The speaker which usually blurts out \"be careful\" (gotta get it to speak in Chinese) gives you a warning sound that sounds like the warning sound you'd get when a landline telephone used to get knocked off the hook for too long if you start to push it at this point. It limits the speed and gets a little cranky if you jump off a curb or over a large pothole at a fast speed under these battery conditions. All in all it wants the rider to be safe and reminds you of this a lot when the battery gets very low. Although the range is a little lacking, it took me around two hours to drive 22 miles. A 2 min stop to change out a new battery for another 22 miles is no big deal, and probably needed as a rest at that point anyway. Changing the battery in the V5F is a great undertaking requiring great feats of double speed fast motion photography, unscrewing and unhooking for 15 mins just to get to the battery compartment and unhook it. So get the V5F+ if you are thinking of range for that EUC. I have already ordered an extra battery for the V8 and charging port to hook it up to my chargers.\nTo sum it all up, upgrading to a wheel to match ones skill level and expanded use is something enriching and easy to do. The options are all around and so far seem to be growing in numbers. I stuck with what was familiar but larger and more powerful. If Kingsong had their KS14S or KS16S available I may have gone with them. One thing to remember- you will use the new wheel in much the same way as the old one for the majority of the time. It should make these journeys more useful and enjoyable. If you can say that about your upgrade, you've succeeded. Some other brief thoughts...\n- I thought the larger 16\" wheel would be more cumbersome- it is actually just as nimble\n- I had no idea how the extra speed would be so natural during the proper conditions. You don't miss what you don't experience...\n- Upgrading to a new wheel takes time to relearn some basic handling of the new machine.",

I fell in love with this monowheel right away...it has a smooth ride, handles great, and the customizable lights make it really fun to ride.\n\nBut this testimonial is really for Jason's customer service. Whenever I had ANY questions for him, he was extremely prompt with his response and always helpful. When I shot him an email about getting the mobile app set up, he replied right away. When I asked him about some LED lights that went out after I dropped my wheel, he sent me replacement LED strips for free under warranty AND included a tutorial on how to install them. And when I put my cover back on and realized that I had lost a screw in the process, he offered to send me on as well.\n\nI can't recommend Jason at eWheels enough. Thanks for all of your help!\n\n-Jon Chintanaroad",

          "content": "I have been researching online and on you tube for several months now on purchasing an electric unicycle, and I finally decided on an Inmotion V8, and decided to purchase from EWheels instead of eBay or ( Amazon, I could only find the V5F there), Due to the Reviews about Jason and the service there.\n\nFirst let me say the three reasons I went with the V8...\n\n1. A more intermediate wheel with power and range I felt like I could grow into, I was afraid I would want to purchase another one in a few months :) maybe not the worst scenario ...\n\n2. The many videos on You Tube that showed and reviewed this wheel all were extremely positive...\n\n3. The only bells and whistles I wanted were the lights and a built in handle and that's it, no speakers etc...\n\nSecondly let me talk about EWheels ...\n\nI placed my order on Friday night March 24th, I ordered the V8 and extra inner tube (I live in AZ lots of pokez (cactus) on the roads as my grandkids would say) and a cover for the V8. First thing Monday morning 3/27 I received an email from Jason at EWheels with a lot of really good information about getting started and links to videos and the app and a message about my order, apparently they were out of the covers and Jason let me know immediately which I thought was extremely proactive and was definitely the right thing to do from a customer experience standpoint, he also promised to send some of the bumper padding at no cost and refund the cost of the cover if he was unable to locate a cover for me. Later that day he sent me another email verifying that he was indeed out of the covers and that he would refund and send me the padding in lieu of the cover. Again I really appreciate his upfront heads-up and short term solution for my order, I really feel like his focus was on making me a happy camper right out of the gate :).\n\nNow the Wheel... wow what can I say except AWESOME!!! it arrived at my house on Thursday 3/30 around noon with an 80% charge and everything in the box packed well and no damage whatsoever :) On Friday I started practicing doing the various things a newbie would do after watching countless hours of video on YouTube lol... I expected I wouldn't even be able to ride it until I practiced for at least one to two weeks for one to two hours a day well guess what :) some how I was able to get the hang of it within that first hour and yea I still need lots of practice but I have been cruising around the neighborhood and even my kids are amazed that I caught on this quick. Now I do have to tell you it was not with some major spills and crashes but I wear the necessary gear (Wrist, knee, elbow and helmet) and yes I have already scratched up the outside not to bad, but if I would have only had the cover on it, it actually would have been worse. Once I get much better I will order a new case anyways but for now the padding is doing its job.\n\nThe only negatives about the wheel for me anyways, was the lack of a pad for the upper calf area however I used some of the padding to solve that for now, it did come with some ankle pads which for me were needed :), and the app which I expected based on the reviews I read.\n\nI will be doing business with Jason and EWheels in the future for replacement parts for the V8 and some accessories. And I'm sure there will be an upgrade in the future to a Gotway maybe a monster :) but for now I am extremely happy with my purchase and with the excellent service provided by Jason,\n\nHopefully I can get some of the videos uploaded soon to you tube.\n\nThanks EWheels,\n\nDanny (Poopa) Thornton",

It took me about 2 hours to feel comfortable going forward and making tight turns. I have put 60 miles on since January 4th when I received my wheel and really enjoy riding it. I have no other wheels to compare my experience but I can say I am impressed with the power and the range so far. I can easily see myself riding an 18 inch wheel with a long range battery by summer 2018. I live in Pennsylvania and I have never seen one of these around but glad I discovered these cool inventions.\n\nThe customer service here is top notch. Jason answered all my questions very fast and everything went smooth. I ordered a cover for the V8 but I received one for a V5. Jason responded with a tracking number for the new cover and a shipping label to return the one for the V5. I received the correct cover in 4 days. Again, I cannot say enough about the customer service here. Overall I would rate my experience a 5 out of 5. Look forward to making another purchase in the future!",

Their non-slip surface is the best I've come across and they make me feel cery confident that my feet will not slip off the wheel under any conditions.  The only bad point would be the \"new\" side pads.  I like the older side pads - they have more padding where it's needed most and the upper padding edge is more \"rounded\" so as to place less pressure on the side of my shin during mounting and dismounting.  The new pads have a sharp upper edge that digs into my shin like a dull knife and after a few mounts/dismounts make my shin begin to REALLY HURT.  I have version 2.00 firmware in my wheel, and when I disable the bluetooth speaker, the wheel will announce \"Blah-tooth is off\" everytime I power up my wheel.  This is a little annoying and I would prefer it if the wheel would NOT announce this everytime I power up.",

This was worth every last penny I spent. From the stand point of someone who wants to use an euc for recreational use, this is perfect for me. The amount of power is great, 800 Watts is more than enough for me. As far as customer service goes, ewheels is perfect. Jason helped me along the with my concerns. Since I am new to personal electric vehicles, I may have had more questions than normal. Jason answered all of my questions and was very helpful.

I logged over 400 miles on that wheel and really needed a wheel that was faster for commuting to work and being able to ride longer distances if needed.  I spoke with Jason about the pros and cons of the different wheels and companies several times.  I like the specs on Gotway but KingSong has a reputation for reliability and I would be using this wheel everyday.  My choices came down to the KS 16S or KS 14S.  When I decided to buy, the 16S was out of stock so I went with the 680 wh KS 14S.  Shipping was so fast and everything was intact when delivered (Thanks eWheels). I opened the packaging and put the wheel on the charger to get a full charge.  The wheel came with a decent charge out of the box. What a night and day difference between the S1 and 14S, this is a super fun and very fast wheel.  I just logged over 300 miles with this wheel and cant express how satisfied I am with my purchase of the KS 14S.  My son has been riding my S1 for the past two weeks and I finally let him take a ride on the 14S and he was blown away by the sheer power and speed. He kept asking how I hold back from zooming past him when we ride together since it is so smooth and quick. Even in strong wind, the 14S pushes through without any issues. I replaced the factory pads with the smooth ones sent from Jason at eWheels and what a huge difference did it make.  It made the wheel so much more enjoyable. The headlight is bright enough to see when riding at night.  The brake light is also a nice addition.  The integrated trolley handle is really nice and necessary as the wheel weighs 34 pounds.  All I can say is this is a awesome EUC that is fast and fun and a pleasure to ride.  eWheels is the only company I will buy from since they have quality products, helpful staff, and awesome warranty.  No other company in the US comes close.",

All have been fun, but I have sold them all off except for the Onewheel. I liked the Boostedboard, but I wasn’t into to small wheel size and having to use a remote. I did not like controlling the Mini Pro with my knees…it did not feel natural. I liked the OneWheel’s ability to go off road, but the 6 mile range was limiting and prevented me from using it as a commuter vehicle.\nI decided to try out an electric unicycle and went with the KS 14C. I purchased the 840wh/800W Motor. I felt that my experience with the OneWheel helped me pick up the KS 14 pretty quickly. It took me a couple of days to feel comfortable, but after that, I really enjoyed this wheel. Compared to the Onewheel, I felt the the 14C was easier to dismount. The OneWheel has a sensor on the foot plate that can be tricky. The 14S allows for easy mounting and dismounting without a problem. The 14” wheel took the grass and bumps a little easier than the 10” OneWheel tire. The range is another thing that really separates the 14S from the other vehicles I have tried. Running out of battery is not a fear on the 14S. The fast charger from eWheels makes the charging experience very convenient as well. I’m not saying the Onewheel or any of the other rideables are bad at all, but I find the KS 14S suits my needs a lot better. I like the 14S so much, I’ve decided to sell my OneWheel and buy a KS 18. I just want to say that Jason at eWheels gave me the best customer service. He answered all of my questions and answered many of my emails after hours and even on the weekends. The whole experience was great and I highly recommend a KS from eWheels.com.",

I went on a 15-mile ride with my buddy who owns an MSuper 18 and was outpacing him the entire way. The app customization options are great too – no one wants to hear beeping as they go faster. Definitely a 10/10 product from someone who’s ridden the “best” in the industry!",

I didn’t try riding again until last weekend, the middle of October. It’s a blast! Today I did my first tour of the subdivision which was about 3 miles. I even went fast enough to get the cautionary beeps (Whoo HOO!), then I quickly slowed down. eWheels.com has been great. There might be an issue with the battery charger topping off the batteries too high, so Jason sent me another one to try out. He got back with me on a Sunday to figure out what to try! If you’re thinking about by a wheel from eWheels Go For It!",

It is fast for its sheer size and weight.  Because it's so tall you can really dig your knees into the frame and lean in.  Every time I ride a friends wheel its always refreshing to jump back on the 18s. There is nothing like except the monster. Sit riding is so nice and a totally different feel than standing. Its like riding a moped with no handlebars. Amazing feeling of freedom.  So much safer than a onewheel with multiple safety features that protect a bigger rider like me from nose diving.  I weigh 275 LB and this thing takes me at fast speeds for hours.  Do yourself a favor and get the bigger battery. I didn't realize how much I needed it until my friend got a 70 mile wheel and that gave me range anxiety.  When they come in I will be upgrading the battery by adding another one. Seriously though buy this wheel you won't regret it.",

You can take a look of the video link where I re-enact the performance of \"Singin' in the Rain\" after the game in Oakland.  Being large and on the heavier side, it was actually more stable than smaller EUC.  I could even do simple tap dancing on the pedal.

I've only unlocked it to 24.8 mph out of 31 and it feels insanely fast yet safe enough to hit that 24.8 while seated. Get the highest battery version or you'll regret it as you'll need to charge from 30-80%. You don't want to demolish your expensive battery. If you've ridden before you'll have no problem riding this and getting up to speed will only take 10-20 high speed runs until your body figures it out. Buy the wrap around padding. Just do it. Trust me. The stock padding doesn't cover but 50% of the area your leg will hit on the wheel and you will need to rest your leg on this wheel unlike smaller wheels. Hmmm what else....... Buy motorcycle armor/a helmet/knee pads if you value your life even a little bit. This thing doesn't exactly stop on a dime and at 31mph I can imagine a big enough pothole/bump bucking you off. While seated, stopping takes twice as long and standing up quickly to stop can be difficult. This is the future, you want this Wheel, 2k feels very reasonable for what you get (even more so if you're replacing your car with this/the bus like I am. Speakers are plenty loud. You need this in your life. I promise.",

          "content": "Let me give you a little background.  I had been using a simple hoverboard as an \"assistant commuter.\"  I would ride it from my house to a commuter train and then from there I would ride it again to work.  I had done this for a year, but the reality of this being so slow for a few of the miles I was on it set in very quickly.\nI was looking for other options that were all electric and also very fun. I had already been known at work and around the work neighborhood as the guy with the hoverboard and somewhat even infamous.  I wanted to ramp it up a notch too with whatever I decided to upgrade to.  I looked into eBikes and then saw a video on YouTube about Electric Unicycles.  As soon as I saw that video, which was for a really cheap and under powered EUC, I knew that I needed to get one.  I started researching what types were available, cost, power, speed, battery size, mileage, etc.\nI settled on either a Gotway Monster 22 or a KingSong KS18S because of the power and mileage capability.  I wanted this to be able to be a full commuter and errand runner.  This would become my primary form of transportation, so it had to be top of the line!  I quickly realized the price for me was high, but definitely worth the cost.  I saved up what I could and even sold some things on eBay to get all the money.  After watching nearly all the videos that are on YouTube about EUCs in general while the time passed, I finally found out about eWheels as the best vendor here in the USA.  I also, during this research, finally decided on the KingSong KS18S, as my biggest priorities were, in this order, distance, safety, quality, and power.  I've found that overall opinion out there is that KingSong, has the best safety and quality ratings of all the EUC vendors.  So I ordered it through eWheels and now I just had to wait for it to arrive.\n\nThree days!  That's all it took to get from California to Utah.  By the way, there's almost no one in Utah with an EUC, so I may even be the only KS18S rider in the state.  That needs to change, we need enough to form a group.\n\nSo here's my experience.  I had no experience on one, so it was entirely up to me to train myself.  I did watch many videos of how to ride one on YouTube, but they only gave my brain the knowledge.  I was VERY UNSUCCESSFUL on my first attempt.  Never once though did my EUC fall or get scratched.  I was extra cautious.  On day two, I was able to ride it, but couldn't quite control where it went, obviously not desirable.  After three days however, it finally clicked in my head somehow and WOW, I was riding an EUC.\nIt was actually only about 3 or 4 hours of trying to ride it as I spent mostly only about an hour each day practicing.  I had no serious falls or close calls, but being tense and inexperienced had me really squeezing the EUC with my knees which caused some minor bruises on both the inside of my knees and ankles.\nOnce I got it down I didn't find much need to squeeze the sides unless I wanted a really quick acceleration or I was climbing a steep hill.  Which this one has NO problems at all doing.  I've mostly ridden it in downtown Salt Lake City and drove it up and down some really serious inclines without any problems.\n\nI've seen some reviews both written and video saying that the KingSong KS18S is NOT a good EUC for beginners.  If that's true then I'm an exceptional rider.  But statistically there shouldn't be anything special about me, so I would say it's a great beginner EUC as it is a top of the line model.  Which means it has plenty of power when you're trying something that you don't know that you shouldn't try as a beginner.  It will NOT cut out suddenly! \nI would recommend this for beginners who have never ridden an EUC, but only IF they have the budget available.\nThis is day four of me riding the KS18S and I already have 45 miles on it and that almost entirely yesterday's distance.  This has quickly become my favorite form of transportation.  \nA special note about learning to ride though; if you want to learn quickly, then you will need to be in good shape.  If you take it slowly then it doesn't require as much out of you physically.  I use an Apple Watch to keep track of steps, movement, heart rate, etc. which I use to meet certain exercise goals.  I blew all those goals out of the water while I was trying to learn it.  Four times as many calories burned; three times as much movement; and twice the exercise were the results of learn this awesome machine.\n\nThe KingSong KS18S is an EUC that shouldn't be passed on if you've got the chance.  I really love the distance, speed and power that comes with this alternate form of travel that has now become my favorite form of travel.",

In all my EUC ownership of all major brands and various shapes and sizes, the KS18, in whatever version, will probably always be a fixture in my EUC rotation, and the only way to ensure A+ US support in such a wheel investment is to buy it from eWheels.com.",

I have right at 500 miles on this wheel and have enjoyed every single ride that I have taken. I and bigger. When I first received the wheel, I could not believe the size difference between the 14s and the 18s. At first it was intimidating wheel just off the sheer size but once I took my first ride, I was hooked and this became my favorite wheel. It is not as nimble as the 14s, but when you cruise, the 18s is so stable at higher speeds and takes road imperfections so much better you don't mind it not being as nimble. But with practice, you can ride with pedestrian traffic without any issues. I get so much attention with this wheel due to the unique shape and sheer speed of the EUC. I bought a motorcycle jacket, gloves, and helmet for added safety since I have to ride on the street since a lot of streets don't have sidewalks that are continuous. I haven't had any issues with either of my King Song EUC's. I trust them and stand by their safety reputation. I attend bike night at the local motorcycle shop bought a King Song 14s in December and wanted another wheel for cruising that was faster and get so much attention from the bikers. I put two 140 lumen red lights that can flash on the trolley handle so I can be seen in the day as well as at night. The speakers are awesome and sound really loud without distortion. The headlight is bright and the taillight is big and bright and lights when you brake. Once again, I am amazed at the quality of this EUC and look forward to riding this wheel for many days to come. I highly recommend this wheel if you want speed, reliability, comfort, and fun!!!   Thank you Jason McNeil for the excellent recommendation on getting this EUC.  Big shot to eWheels for super fast shipping and excellent customer service!!  I will be buying all my EUC's from eWheels!!",

For an 18 in. wheel, the pedal hardness is outstanding. It is very responsive at accelerating and breaking. It climbs hills very well. The automating headlights and break lights are a key feature. Speakers are a great feature as well. If you take longer rides, I highly recommend this wheel. Jason at ewheels is the best. I have no reason to shop anywhere else.

I’ve been riding electric skateboards for years but, the first time I saw an electric unicycle, oh man, I just got the concept right away. NOTHING compares to the level of freedom and the natural feel that unicycle will give you. Being annoyed with my skateboard’s limitation of only being able to run on smooth terrain, I was in the market for an off road electric skateboard, that’s when I discovered the electric unicycle. No skateboard will ever match the flexibility and the ability and the speed to traverse as much different terrain as my 18’’ wheeled King Song. After much looking around and shopping, I found eWheels to have the best selection/price on the internet. Additionally, I want to mention that dealing with eWheels has been a sheer pleasure. I’ll spare you the long story but, let me just say that the kind of honesty, integrity and honor this place operates under is not always demonstrated by on-line vendors.

I did ride for about 30 miles the first two days so maybe there is a break in period, but my legs were sore for a few days. Think they could of made them a bit softer. I will modify it myself, but would be nice to come stock)\n\nHighly recommend this EUC to anyone looking to keep speed in check but still have a good time.",

          "content": "This is a follow-up review from a rider in Seattle.  After four 2 hour sessions, I was confident to put the wheel anywhere my mind wanted it to go.  Once your muscle memory gets locked in, it is no longer a wheel you control, it is a magic carpet responding to your very thoughts.  I agree on the durability factor.  Those first sessions and a healthy dose of fear saw me leaping off of the machine as I watched it clatter and scrape to a stop.  It survived all of my temporary abandonments and actually still looks pretty decent (all black is a good color to hide the scrapes).  Several months later and after many accumulated miles, I can dance to the music from my phone spinning and swaying with the beat, maneuver the wheel in very tight spaces and feel the thrill of flying at top speed.  I have taken recently to hopping off curbs and catching some air going over speed bumps.  I have never gotten close to running the battery down as it goes for hours.  One more detail, I am almost 63 years old.  I bought this to challenge myself and it has become second nature to cruise in the neighborhood and up to the local school yard to further hone my riding skills on smooth tarmac and lumpy soccer fields.  A very cool thing to own and master.  While I have not fallen seriously over these last several months (only went down once at very low speed during session 3-scraped palm of a wrist guard and a bruise on the hip), I am not keen on riding without a good set of knee, elbow, & wrist guards and my bike helmet.  No point inviting disaster by riding free for the little money it takes to get a good and comfy set of protective pads.  If you are in reasonably good shape, you can do this activity and it is really like no other.  The 16S is an impressive and elegant piece of technology.",

I documented my journey learning on it and I think Jason and the entire eWheels company is doing a fantastic job providing excellent old school customer service that is honest and reliable.  The wheel is nimble, its speed is enough for my needs at the moment and it handles a lot of different type of terrain very well. I suggest Hard mode once you get comfortable on the device, the wheel feels more easier to ride. I will def be picking a new wheel in the future from these guys.

Acceleration is great, I often beat cars off the line up until around 15mph! Surprising amount of power up the ridiculous hills where I live too. Can take me up while cruising 18mph no problem. Also, King Song trolley handles are the bees knees. The only thing I don't totally dig is the side pads. I don't like how far they stick out - if the pedals were just set slightly wider, that would be nice. The contact point is also a little low - a taller wheel distributes the load along your leg better, which is more comfortable for mounting/dismounting or one-legged riding. These are relatively minor quibbles. This is a great wheel to have around. Due to where I frequently ride, I've found myself more comfortable on a wheel capable of ~25mph+ so that I can ride in traffic when necessary. Cyclists here are just super unpredictable, and passing them can be pretty dangerous. That said, I do wear CE rated knee and elbow impact protection, wrist guards, and a full face helmet.

My daughter and I spent most of Father's Day getting up to speed on the wheel.  My daughter was frustrated because I was able to go further and turn quicker than she could.  She didn't think she would get it but after about 2 hours of switching off, we both were cruising around having a ball!  I tried the intermediate and expert modes and decided to stick with the beginner mode, but removed the speed limiter.  There is a lot of room to grow with this wheel!  The only negative I can think of is the weight of these euc's.  But it's well worth it for the smiles for miles your will enjoy!  I plan on commuting with this as soon as I feel more proficient.  The Black Matte finish has been holding up to the drops it's endured with no extra padding for protection.  I am so glad I went through with the purchase... Thanks Ewheels!",

I don't really feel the need for the high end speed (I commute to/from public transit and only have a mile on each end to ride) but the higher torque motor and the additional range are amazing. The higher torque holds the pedals rock solid -- gives a very strong sense that the wheel isn't going to let you fall. The additional range is just nice to have, knowing I can tool around at lunch and not have to worry about range. \n\nMy only reason for going 4 stars not 5 is the app. SO SKETCHY. Not in google's playstore. The app asks for so many permissions on the phone. Does it really have to have all that access just to unlock the wheel and set a few parameters. No way to run the app without completely dropping all pretext of security on your phone. Probably there is nothing untoward going on... but if someone WERE planning to sneak some darkweb nasty shxt onto my phone, it would look a lot like installing the Kingsong App.",

Recently, on a trip to Canada, I decided I wanted to bring  my euc along.  It was difficult finding a bag that it fit into so I could bring it along on the bus.  I prepared to go for my first ride in Canada.  I left my hotel room and went to pick up the euc to go down the stairs  when the handle broke off.  Before  I had a chance to react, the euc went tumbling down the stairs.  The euc  was still operational but the handle was left in my hand.  I realized just how handy and convinient the handle is.  Therefore, I will have to order a new handle when I get back to the States.  I will also be ordering the larger pedals.  \nConcerning the app, its terribly frustrating to use.  Though  I have gotten use to it.  One problem  I'm having is the Km left to go. It keeps going back to 74km when I turn the unit on.  I currently  have close to 400 miles.

          "content": "A couple of caveats: first, I've only had the KS16S for a few days now and just out on a couple of rides, I think I've got 13 km on it thus far.  And the other is just that I give this machine 5 stars not to suggest that it's perfect --- no Electric Unicycle that I'm aware of is at risk of achieving perfection --- but because I think this might well be the best of the bunch.   I have two other EUCs, both of which have a max speed of about 18 kph (12 mph or so).  For both of these, I get really tired of hearing beeping or vocal admonishment or pedal tilt-back telling me that I'm going too fast.   With the KS16S, once I was able to unlock the top speed, it's just a joy to ride as fast as I want to, as the top speed of 35 kph is definitely faster than I personally want to go on any of these devices.\n\nSo downsides: first the software is clumsy.  eWheels does a good job, I really appreciate the email that they sent with getting started information and details to help mitigate how confusing the software situation.  I ultimately installed the suggested older version of the Android software on my phone to speed unlock the machine, then WheelLog (now WheelInfo) app for more common use.  But expect to require some patience and at least a little frustration en route.\n\nSecond, I hear a high pitched sound from this machine when it's turned on, even when it's at rest, and it's louder when it's being used.  This isn't a deal killer for me, but it's unfortunately.  I presume that I'll get used to it.  It makes more typical EUC motor noise as well, no problem at all there, it's a pretty modest sound really.  But my other EUCs don't make this kind of high pitched sound.  Reading online I see that others report the same thing, so I don't think this is unique to my unit.\n\nThe machine arrived very well packed from the factory, and whiles software and documentation seem to be an after-thought, the hardware is great.   Okay, one other thing that probably just reflects my ignorance --- from my other lower speed and lower power units, I had this fantasy that with the KS16S it would just easily power up any hills I want to go up with zero deceleration or struggle.  It certainly does better at this than the other units, but I find that if I approach a fairly steep hill with little speed/momentum, I cannot accelerate up the hill to anywhere near the top speed of the unit, and I'm not a particularly heavy guy (or at least not heavy by U.S. standards? :-)) --- I weigh perhaps 165 pounds (75 kilos).\n\nIn my initial testing, I found that the unit handles reasonably packed gravel just fine.  Riding on compacted bark was a little more tedious, but do-able.   I like the no-nonsense approach of how it just turns on without any fuss or drama, ditto turning it off, and the recharging port is very easy to access (unlike the one on my IPS i5 which takes a bit more fiddling).    I had thought that I wouldn't be interested in the flashing side lights, but they are kind of cool --- for now at least, I'm keeping them on!  In my initial 13 km of riding the battery power (displayed using lights) hasn't budged, and I really like the idea that for any reasonable distance that I ever might want to ride, I'll have plenty of excess battery capacity (range) to get me there.    And of course, I very much like the reported safety and quality of King Song unicycles, though I have nothing personal I can contribute to either of those factors, at least at this point.\n\nBottom line is that I'm pleased with this and look forward to riding a lot more to get more comfortable with this particular unit and its capabilities and 'feel'.",

Jason and his team have amazing customer service, email updates every step of the way,  Realistic and accurate expectations for ETA. A very detailed and helpful email startup guide was also sent prior to receiving the wheel. \n\nThe wheel shipped on the 8th, I got the wheel May 10th 2018, Everyday ive been riding this, and each time i try and double the riding distance. On May 13th I put on 80km in one day (short recharge in the middle of the day). Learning wasn't nearly as hard as i though it would be. My recommendation is finding a flat open field of grass (soccer field), that way if you fall off, the wheel doesn't get damaged, its also good for learning the limits of how far you can lean and how sharp you can turn. Learning to ride on grass is harder, but when you transition to pavement its a piece of cake. I also recommend learning low speed precision control before going out where there is lots of people. \n\nI did a ridiculous amount of research before i chose the KingSong, i am very glad i picked this one, even after riding it and watching more youtube videos, i still think this is the best wheel for the money. I only wish it had a power cut button under the handle for going up stairs but i just turn off the power all together, no big deal. The range and power on this wheel is just perfect, i cant think of changing it to anything else that would be a noticeable improvement. The kingsong app is horrendous but it really does not affect the wheel since your normal running app can be darknessbot or wheellog.\n\neWheels is Top Tier in my opinion, if you are on fence buying from this shop, just do it, you will not regret it.",

The main features of an EUC which affect its safety are the power (power equals stability for a EUC) and reliability. 16s is the top at both of them (the failure rate of 16s is less than 1% since the beginning of sales in spring 2017). \n18s is also a very nice and even more powerful device, but it's much larger and higher and not comfortable for some riders and some applications.\n16s may soon be challenged by the new Kingsong model 18L, but for now there's really no competition. No other manufacturer even gets any close. \nI've made more than 2500 miles on a 16s since July and still absolutely happy with the thing, not a slightest hiccup so far. \nAnd for those who never used an EUC. This is NOT a toy like hoverboards and even segways, this is a fantastic personal urban transport, the best one invented so far. \nPS: Do NOT buy older Kingsong models (\"A, B, C\" models).

Definitely nervous about such a\nlarge $ purchase on something that might prove to be nothing more than a novelty (or a complete disaster). I went for it anyway. I needed something to get me out of the house, that didn’t’ require me to go someplace else to use it, give me a sense of of adventure, exhilaration and dare I say put a smile on my face. The KingSong 16s has exceeded my expectations. I’ve also enjoyed the learning curve – a sense of genuine accomplishment in the real world where tactile and physical forces are the name of the game. There’s nothing like spending the 1st several hours doing nothing but crashing every few feet to wobbling along for a few yards, then finally being able to cautiously make it down the street. I’ve since logged over 100 miles and now I’m feeling like a super hero flying around town, up and down hills, on and off of sidewalks, and taking sharper and sharper turns with ease and precision. Recently I joked with Jason at eWheels that they should consider starting an EUC Anonymous group to begin addressing the addictiveness of these machines. Seriously, riding around and improving my skills is all I want to do anymore. So, about the KingSong 16s; fast, has great acceleration, nimble, durable, cool features, and has an overall sense of quality about it. The 16s is not a toy, it’s a serious machine for folks that are interested in getting out of the norm and experiencing the cutting edge of fun!

The order shipped the same day and I received it 2 days later since I live in California and the wheel shipped from Los Angeles. Couldn’t be happier with the speed of order processing and shipment ! After you order, you get an informational message about the particular model you ordered with useful information to get you ready. This is really a nice touch and is sent in addition to the order receipt. When I received the order, the wheel was in perfect condition and actually looked better in real life than in pictures. I’ve had a chance to ride it a few times now and I say it’s really good upgrade path for Ninebot E+ owner, especially with regards to the range which from my initial experience looks to be about 3 times the range. I will be writing a more thorough comparison later that I will post to the forum.electricunicycle.org with the pros and cons of this model. This is a great site to buy EUC with complete confidence that you will get the service and support when you need it (and you will). eWheels answered all my questions pre and post purchase and he is very reputable among the EUC community. I’m 100% satisfied with the purchase that I have no trouble recommending this site to people I meet who are also looking to buy electric unicycle. Do not buy from random sources on the Internet where you won’t get warranty or support. eWheels will definitely have my repeat business in the future when I decide to upgrade again",

I’ve ridden almost 200 miles on it so far and having so much fun. It’s worth the learning curve. E-wheels is the place to purchase. No regrets, in fact, trying to buy another for the wife!",

I wanted something that had enough battery to transport me to and fro, without worries of running out of power.  However, I needed something that was going to be durable enough to handle the rigors of urban dwelling.  (Rough streets and rude drivers.)  \n\nThe Dualtron 3 is larger and faster than most urban scooters, but I feel that while it's considered more of an \"off road,\" scooter, I like to think of it as being the perfect \"Urban Assault Scooter.\"  It handled steep grades with no problem. It too on uneven sidewalks and streets easily.  I came off of a moderate to high level curb, with enough clearance to feel comfortable about my scooter's capabilities, and kept rolling.\n\nThe speed, handling and suspension system of the Dualtron 3 make this a great urban scooter.  The beefy nature of the scooter build also makes me feel that it's the better choice for the commutes that I'll have to endure of days as well. And with proper care and maintenance, it should do so for a long time to come.\n\nIt's not a lightweight scooter that one will carry around in the office, or on public transit.  However, if you're using it as your main source of durable transportation, on city streets, to get to your destination and back again, one can't go wrong with the Dualtron 3.",

          "content": "First off, thank you Jason from eWheels for answering all my emails promptly and for all the info regarding purchasing and using this scooter. I was a little hesitant in ordering such an expensive scooter but eWheels came through and delivered without any problems. The bonus fingerprint reader was factory installed and the added fast charger came separately a day before the scooter arrived. Anyway, I wanted to put at least 250 miles before I wrote this short review. I purchased the Thunder primarily for commuting purposes from Southern Brooklyn to Midtown Manhattan, NYC (~15 miles one way). When used on max settings, I use around 23% battery for the one way trip that consists of stop and go traffic, moderately high uphills  (especially on bridges) and straightaway path speeds up to 30 mph. Although this scooter can reach up to 50mph, I dare not to on public roads for the safety of others and myself. Even at 30mph, this is can be very dangerous. It also took me some time to get used to the throttle. It is very sensitive so I ended up using low power settings at first and made sure to enable kickstart mode. For the most part this is a solid, well built scooter with high quality parts. It has held up pretty good for my purpose. The only exception is the hinge part where the shaft folds down. This part started squeaking at around 150 miles and has minor play. I’m not sure if it specific to my scooter or with all but I find myself constantly adjusting and tightening bolts. According to the manual this part of the scooter should be replaced after one year or 3000 miles depending which comes first. Even with this issue, I would still recommend buying the Thunder.",

Going straight doesn't seem to be much of a problem for it on ice but turning does become an issue if your not careful.  The ABS is amazing! Stuttering to a stop instead of sliding.  I did have to turn the acceleration down to make more snow friendly.  Once it warms up a bit I plan on using it to get to work daily and take it on hiking trails, I suppose I'll have to update my review once I've had a chance to play on it more but for what I've done on it so far The Dualtron Thunder has been amazing!",

Compared to Ultra, it's an improvement in many ways. The hydraulic brakes, cable insulation/management, 3 button display with an easy max power mode switch, stock road tubeless tires.\n\nI'm glad that I've ordered from eWheels since for the same price as other dealers you get a fast 5A charger with the feature to limit the max charge to 70-80-90% which will prolong your battery life. They also install a fingerprint scanner.\n\nI did have a couple of issues with the scooter, but eWheels support was great and solved the problems I had (either by sending the spare parts or by providing the detailed instructions to get it fixed by myself).\n\nIt's not a 100% polished model and it has a couple of minor problems: wires can be still damaged in some places, there is a play in the folding section that is impossible to fix and you will have to just ignore it, there is no stock light installed for the safe night riding.\n\nFor the headlight I'd recommend the Fenix BC35R (or the previous model).\n\nIt's really a great scooter, but you need to be prepared to fix some issues. If you are an engineer, just buy it already!",

          "content": "The best scooter out there. Period. Coming from a Dualtron 2 Ex, the Thunder feels like an entirely different scooter with a much more premium feel and look. But it comes at a hefty price, which is the only reason for me docking a star off its score. \n- The speed is amazing. You WILL beat cars off the line at green lights, but be sure to hold on tight because this much torque in the dual motors mode feels like a punch in the gut. \n- The range is impressive if you aren’t speed hungry and stay under 30mph. I can ride around in mild temperatures (50F) for around 3 hours before getting down to the last critical 15%\n- The wide tires allow you to ride with one hand which makes sending text messages at slow speeds doable without having to dismount. It also means you can adjust settings with one hand steering without it going squirrelly on you and tilting too much. Very premium. \n- The logo LED on the handle that lights up is viewable even in daylight and looks awesome. There’s also blue mood lighting that projects under the deck. I’ve gotten more “wows” from the Thunder (at night) then even from my electric unicycles. \n- THE HYDRAULIC BRAKES! OH my goodness. A major upgrade from the mechanical brakes of even my dualtron 2 with its dual disc brakes. The new braking system feels like a motorcycles brakes, smooth delivery with incredible stopping power. I can ride right up behind cars now without giving them too much following distance like I used to on thr dualtron 2, because I know the brakes can stop me on a dime. The new brakes alone are worth the $500 more from the Ultra. Supreme confidence and safety. I haven’t tried ABS braking yet so it can only get better. \n- Did I mention the speed? I hit 53mph on a straight (i’m 190 pounds with helmet/gear) easily enough speed to handle any city or town road. \n- The brake lights are a lot safer than any scooter I know. It flashes pops of yellow along with lighting up the typical red brakes, to grab drivers attention that you’re stopping. There’s even a hazard button that flashes strobes of yellow in the rear just like in a car!\n- The deck is very wide and comfortable for standing feet side by side. The new settings display is much easier to change things on. You’ll be happy to know that the ECO/TURBO button is gone (replaced with hazard lights) so you no longer have to worry about accidentally turning on eco mode instead of dual motors(happened a couple times on my dualtron 2, was wondering why I was going so slow when I saw eco mode had been pressed in.)",

I had to come with my own home solution for these paddings.  And I am reading that it is not only me, complaining. Even expert riders add their own padding for comfort and stability.  This is the reason why I give the wheel 4 stars.",

The tilt sensor isn't timid about tilting you backwards once you pass 18mph. It only took me about an hour to learn basics how to ride with youtube videos, now 2 days later i feel alot more confident in my ability, can almost drain the battery in one ride, ride through grass and dirt, up and down small curbs. What's stopping me is soreness from the muscles I've been building while riding. It's takes alot of balance and most of your weight ends of leaning on your shins pressed against the wheel. Im still getting used to that with bruised shins, i should take a day or 2 break and let them heal but it's soo much fun I can't stop haha my only complaint is the King Song App. EWheels sent me an email about a different app that actually worked better. But it still lacked key info from real app. So sometimes i need to switch between apps, can be a pain. App is required to unlock the wheel when it first arrives, but after that you never need to use the app again.",

I'm 35lbs over recommended weight and it did not hinder the functioning of this lil machine at all, the extra weight does drain the battery quicker. Sorry I can't say what I got in range on single charge because I upgraded quickly because I knew I was sticking with riding EUC so I needed range. I have crashed it several times and besides some scratches it continues to work totally fine. The trolley handle works really well, it will work better for someone shorter but I have long arms so it worked for me, BTW, KingSong has best trolley handle designs. I got the 14D up to 18 mph with no problem, keep in mind I'm over the weight limit, so again impressive! \n  I can tell that KingSong really puts time/effort into it making a product that will make the whole experience of owning and riding a EUC safe, functional and enjoyable! \nI wish I had more input to give regarding extended durability if this KingSong 14D but I only put lil over hundred miles on it before I was upgrading. But again this lil wheel impressed me, it has taken me up steep inclines, light off roading and it's handle it like A TANK! \nIf money is tight and you're not sure this type of experience will be something you will stick with, get this because you still be be getting a quality machine, that won't break the bank. The speakers are fair, I liked the lights more than I thought I would but with that said, personally I can do without lights and speakers.\n   I know myself will enough to know that just by watching YouTube videos that I was going to love having a EUC so I wish I had skipped this wheel and purchased a wheel that I had plenty of room to grow into. I have a Gotway MSP now and I wish it had been my first wheel. Because of health issues the EUC replaced my bicycle, so it's given me back my freedom to get back outside, have fun and see the world, one trail at a time! Riding a EUC is such a freeing sensation!! I have to admit though, I honestly viewed EUC's as toys before I rode one but I quickly realized these EUCs are built tough, so now I consider them as legit personal transportation vehicles.\n\nMy experience with Ewheels: I'm old school in the since that I value professionalism, I believe in doing what you say and if you mess up, admit it and do all you can to make things right, these are values that are almost extinct now days!!! Except for this company, I'm TOTALLY pleased with my dealings with them! Ewheels values their customers and they strive to make their customers completely satisfied!!!! I've purchased 4 wheels from them and you should buy your wheel from them also!",

It's a little more nimble than my InMotion V8, because the 14D has a smaller wheel, but I think that nimbleness which might make it better on busy sidewalks, makes it a bit harder to learn to ride than the V8.\n\nThe King Song Motor cutoff switch (stops wheel from spinning when you pick it up) senses that you're lifting the weight of the wheel from the handle (which is also the trolley handle.)  It's automatic.  This model also has headlights on both ends and Bluetooth speakers and a USB port for charging your phone etc. - Nice extras.",

As far as I can tell, it's just a baby version of the 18XL or 16S.\n\nAnd it can really take a beating! I must've dumped it 30 times so far, and other than some scratches on the glossy finish, no harm done that I can tell.\n\nThe only negative I can come up with is the pads. Really hard on the inside of my calves. I think that's an issue of technique and muscle buildup I'll overcome in a couple weeks. But that's why I deducted 1 point. I think a pad (even some sort of extension like a seat?) that hit closer to the knees instead of mid-shin would solve that.\n\nBecause of the size and performance limits, I think it'll be a great wheel for my son when I do eventually move on to something bigger/faster/longer-range.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the wheel to anyone new to EUCs would wanted something fun to try out. And if you don't plan to commute with it, or are in a lower-speed dense urban area with bike lanes for the most part, I think you could probably live with it happily as your only wheel for a very long time.",

The lights on the front and back are nice safety features for night time\n\nQuirks - The apps are really janky and you need to download them to unlock the speed\n\nSuggestions to manufacturer for improvement - the telescoping handle could go a little higher, I'm not that tall so it's manageable but if I were any taller i would have to be very hunched over to use it. \nThe speed is controlled electronically and if you are exceeding the max speed it will beep and pull you back a little bit, this is fine on flat ground but when the battery is running low and you are going up hill it thinks you are going max speed when you are not going very fast. I think the speed is measured by measuring some variable of energy usage rather than calculating rotational speed\n\nOverall I love this device, all my friends thought I was a weirdo for buying one, but they are slowly coming around to understanding this is the future of transportation!",

I took it out and went through the necessary 15-30 minutes of just trying to roll the the thing a few feet before it clicked. For about a month she showed no interest in it until she happened to see me gliding (i ride it to work everyday) and she agreed to give it a try. She can be a bit uncoordinated, so she hasn't taken to it as quickly as I have, but she's stubborn. The point is, anyone can learn to ride this thing and just standing on it is enough to make you a believer. She told me to get her one for her birthday. Can't wait for our first riding date.\nSome things you should know:\nIt's awesome and I love it. I can attest to what has been said about slower models, I wanted to max this thing out as soon as it would let me (5km traveled). I have very little desire to go faster, especially after my crash at top speed, more on that later.\nIt is sturdy. I fell off the front at 18 mph, skidded several feet across the road, and thanks to my liberal application of padding, there was barely a scratch on the unicycle. Me not so much, but I was lucky. Wear pads.\nIt's going to take a few days to get proficient. After the first training session, I was very sore. Muscles I don't use very much got a real work out and until you can balance and shift your weight proficiently you're going to bang up your legs.\nHeed the tilt back warning. The only crash I've had was a bad one and it was all because I was stupid. Once I hit the top speed I tried leaning even harder into it to see how fast I could go. Once you reach top speed, that is it. If you lean more, it's not going to speed up, which means no more torque, which means there's nothing to keep you upright. Painful lesson but I did it for you guys and gals. The good news is that it took concerted effort and stupidity to lean over the tilt back so you can't do it accidentally.\nWhen joy riding I very rarely reach half battery capacity, the point where you begin to slow down. I'm usually a bit tired and cold by then and happy to wind down, but if 30-45 minutes isn't a long enough ride for you, consider the 14S.",

I have no experience on other wheels but I am learning pretty quickly and can ride without needing to balance against a wall after about 3 hours of practice. I am enjoying it. The wheel's extra features like headlight, LED lights, charging port are great additions. The telescoping handle has been very useful as well. Very happy with it so far.",

I weigh 190 lbs and I found it was responsive, smooth and nimble.  My daughter weighs 90 lbs and the wheel performs flawlessly for her, with great range and handling.  She can pick it up easily on her own (it weighs 27.5 lbs) and it's much more compact than I thought it would be.  This is a great wheel for a first time rider (child or adult).  I'll be ordering a Kingsong 16S for myself so my daughter and I can go on rides together.",

I was looking at a cheaper wheel to learn on and he recommended the KingSong 14D, I hesitated because it was a couple hundred dollars more, but decided to take his advice and I’m glad I did! This thing is top quality and the travel handle is perfect. The nice thing about it is I won’t grow out of it in a few weeks. I’m already riding all over my neighborhood and if I want to get more speed, I can unlock the speed limiter! Trust me, if your like me and just starting out the KingSong 14D is the one!

I was nervous making a large purchase from a company I was unfamiliar with, so I reached out via email before I placed my order, and Jason was really great to work with.

          "content": "Brilliant scooter - got it because I scrapped my car recently and thought about just how much that 500 USD car ended up costing me in the two years I managed to keep it running. This is, by far, the more economical option.\n\nGreat construction, compared against a 250 USD Gotrax \"Rival\" I tried out to be sure I'd like a scooter vs. walking -- the first thing I noticed was that this uses proper metals for the dang screws, which is not a given in most product markets so yay for details. But the whole thing is quite sturdy construction, bolts where one would want bolts, etc. If I had to guess at a weak spot it'd be the stem clamp screws (added some loctite to fix the wobble after a couple days) and possibly the bolt that holds the stem to the body, not the one that locks the fold but the fixed one, so keep an eye on that one would be my bet. Speaking of the bolt that locks the body into folded and unfolded, that thing is solid and so much better than lever methods, for my money. \n\nI weigh right at 20 stone (280 lbs or so) and this thing doesn't even notice me. The fact the suspension holds up means it's probably pretty firm for a lighter rider. The \"gears\" for speed give you some \"out of the box\" flexibility, especially because they behave differently with eco mode or turbo mode selected, and slightly differently with single or dual motor selected. 2 in eco mode, single motor caps around 15mph or so, so that's a good place to practice riding. I feel really unsafe going over 20mph as of yet, so after some fiddling I found that setting the power % limiter (option P7 on the throttle, I think) to 65% I can put it in turbo, dual motor, and cap out at 18mph, while not losing speed on the grade coming home, and more traction in general. Also I vaguely worry about running in single-motor mode permanently, that might be entirely unfounded tho. \n\nCommute effect: 30-45 minutes (basically 30 to work and 45 coming home for obvious reasons) is now about 10 each way, 15 actual trip time (from backroom of store to my front door). So I can be making dinner by 7:20-30 AM rather than 8 or 8:15. Also set my wake-up alarm 15 minutes later. Real world effect is disproportionate to actual trip-time saved, and very worth it, especially on those days I just really don't want to walk home. On the negative side: Rain is a bigger problem vs walking -- it's (relatively) safe to ride in some rain, albeit slowly, but I wear glasses so riding while it is *currently* raining isn't an option, can't see a thing. Umbrellas aren't an option for obvious reasons.\n\nSturdiness: I'd dropped it several times, hit a bump and just end up ditching it and so forth, and also once hit a patch of mud, skidded into grass, the wheel just got stuck and flipped me and the thing over. I had some cleaning to do, to get mud out of the brake handle, brakes, off the throttle, etc., but the only harm it did was to the \"speedway\" logo light on the right side, which also works again now because it was just water got in the lens, not a crack in the filter. There's not a mark on the thing after  a fair bit of flinging it around, learning to ride. So that's a good sign. \n\nBasically, the only complain I can think of is the brake disc makes noise because bits of dirt/sand get in it, which you can wipe off and they just get back in as soon as you ride it. I thought they were just too tight at first, I was wrong, and also had trouble getting them tight again, so try wiping the disc off before you loosen the brakes if its just an odd noise yer after.\n\nOnce, I started it and there was rather strong vibration, rattling the whole stem. Still not sure what that was, was around the front motor, the speed capped at 10mph on the speedometer and it felt like a \"let go\" when it went back to normal maybe 30 seconds later. If I had to guess, it was the electric brake - I turned that off for a ride and then back on and it hasn't happened since, but it may have been something else entirely, dunno.\n\nFor completion's sake, the fingerprint scanner was missing a screw that goes thru the two circles and holds it to the handlebars. I just used a machine screw I had lying around which fit. It's a small oversight and I've done plenty similar at my own job :P. \n\nSo yeah, really nothing to complain about here, get's me to points a and b without much fuss, only have to charge once a week, and that'll take no time at all when the fast charger gets here - as well as, unless I'm misunderstanding how kw hours are measured, it costs like 20-25c to charge this thing, vs. like 10+ a week in gas for a car even with the currently worryingly low price per gallon in the US. Moreover, it's enough I *could* go into town, take maybe half an hour at 20mph to hit the city limits, so maybe a 2 hour travel time for a trip to town, counting moving to the square and one or two other locations? Not bad. \n\nHere's the absolute best perspective I can put on it tho. This was 3.5 paychecks, for me, and I'm not disappointed. Whether yer looking for a commute vehicle and the cost is dear to you, or a toy for the weekend and it's not, thing's worth the cost.",

          "content": "I previously had an Emove Cruiser which is related to the Speedway V in design except that the Speedway 5 has dual motors, better suspension and is overall better in quality.  I especially like the folding mechanism and the fact that it won't tip over when folded.  Often I take the ferry and park the scooter under the stairway on the boat.  Since the boat can rock back and forth it's much better to fold the scooter so it won't tip over and scratch or damage the handlebar or other parts.\n\nThis is a heavy duty scooter.  Since I now live on the ground floor, it's not a big deal that the scooter is so heavy.  \n\nGiven the excellent acceleration, I feel comfortable when having to drive with traffic in Brooklyn.  Of course I would never get on the highway but it's great for surface streets when you have to keep up with traffic.  Generally I ride on the bike lanes but occasionally have to switch to the road.\n\nI added a bar-end mirror on my left side handlebar so I can see if traffic is behind me... Unfortunately, I had to cut a hole in the handlebar end to accommodate the mirror but there isn't much room due to the cylinder spring that allows the handlebars to fold.\n\nI loved the deal with the fast charger and finger print scanner.  I was thinking of purchasing from a different dealer but these two extras along with the warranty sealed the deal with eWheels.\n\nLooking forward to the warmer months as I simply gave it a test drive here in February in NYC.  Even though we are having a mild winter, I prefer to ride in a bit warmer weather.",

          "content": "The speedway V is incredible for commuting! I commute through Washington DC everyday and it has made my commute faster. The acceleration is crazy fast and I can pass cars easily from a stop at red lights. Suspension is quite good, makes bumps and potholes not bad to go over at higher speeds. The battery life is good, with all the speed setting on max I use about 33% battery on my commute which is 16 miles with a lot of steep hills. If your riding on the roads it’s nice to be able accelerate fast to get around cars and out of the way of bad drivers. Make sure to adjust the brakes to your liking. Great brakes. All around a 5 star scooter and definitely worth the price$!",

          "content": "The Speedway 5 is a heavy, powerful, long range, hill crushing, street scooter. It's a legitimate commuting machine if you need to commute over moderately long distances, and/or over significant hills. \nI'm 185lbs and live in a very hilly area. The road to my house has a steep half mile ascent that would make any single motor scooter give up and die. The Speedway 5 cruises up the hillside at 20-25mph no problem. \nOn flat ground I've managed to hit a top speed of 34mph before I chickened out (*I was wearing a full face helmet, motorcycle jacket w/ ce rated padding, jeans, knee pads, and high tops.), and range is extremely impressive. The longest ride I've taken is 20 miles, and I used approx. 50% battery with steep hills included. I think I can get a solid 35 miles, real world around my house, and at least 5 miles more if I just rode on flat ground. \n\nOne thing to note, out of the box you will want to give it a through once over, and apply loctite to the screws around the handlebar & stem, adjust the handlebar accessories to your liking, check the tires, etc. \n\nLastly, eWheels.com has great service, and the entire process was smooth and pain free.

          "content": "After doing my research, I went with the SpeedWay V vs a Dualtron. Size and weight was a major point. I drive a Fiat 500e and I needed to be able to pull the eScooter in and out of the small space I have to work with. \n\nWas afraid the SpeedWay V was going to be underpowered compare to the Dualtron and thought maybe should have gotten the Dualtron after playing the order. But the SpeedWay V performance is amazing! Even with just having one wheel enabled, no turbo and all other settings set to default its fast enough. I’m about 150-160 lbs and was able to get up to 19mph. Enabling dual wheels was able to get up to 22-23mph and was pretty fast. Enabling Turbo made it even faster and didn’t really attempt to see how fast it would go I chickened out. This eScooter is quick and has plenty of torque. The suspension felt great. Brakes, I think the Rear could be stronger. The front brakes grips harder, I might need to adjust the rear. \n\nOut of the box, there is some assembly. The Brake handles and controls need to be adjusted to rider preference. Bolts should be check to made sure tight. I had bolts in the stem that was loose. Headlight needs to be installed. \n\nThe pin the locks the stem of the Scooter was really tight. The user manual doesn’t say how far the Pin needs to go into the hole, but figured out it needs to fully go all the way in till It stops. After some use it should get easier. \n\nNo mention of charge out of the box… The Scooter came with about 50% charge. I test drove it around for a bit and then charged it with the 5A Fast Charger Which I set it to 80% and 5A. Took about 2 hours. When powered up to verify Scooter showed 90%. I rode it day after about 5 miles with only 1 wheel enabled. I was down to 88%. ReGen still on default setting worked great. \n\nThe Right controls kept the sleeve that locks the handle bar from fully pulling out to fold down and would rub. Left side was fine. \n\nThe Handle Bar enter being square stock limits what you can mount to the handle bar. Since most items like headlights and phone holder mount to round tube bars. So aftermarket handle bar extenders need to be sourced to mount additional lights or items.\n\nThe headlight that comes with the scooter is Okay. I added additional 1600 Lumens headlight up top for better night time riding. \n\nOverall, the Scooter is a great performer and happy with it!",
